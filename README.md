## ‚ùì What is an ASN?

An **ASN (Autonomous System Number)** is a unique identifier assigned to a network or group of IP prefixes under the control of a single organization that presents a common routing policy to the internet.

ASNs are used by ISPs, large companies, and cloud providers to announce IP ranges (also called "routes") using the BGP protocol.

### üîé Example:
- **Google ASN**: `AS15169`
- **Cloudflare ASN**: `AS13335`
 
Each ASN may be responsible for hundreds or thousands of IP ranges used in their infrastructure.

This script lets you input any ASN and get a full list of public IPs that ASN announces.

##  Features

- Accepts ASN with or without the `AS` prefix (e.g., `13335` or `AS13335`)
- Retrieves:
  - Organization name
  - All routed IP prefixes from whois.radb.net
- Optionally saves output to a file
- Lightweight ‚Äî pure Bash with just `whois` as a dependency
